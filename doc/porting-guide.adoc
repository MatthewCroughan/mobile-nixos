= Device Porting Guide
include::_support/common.inc[]

NOTE: This subject needs to be expanded upon.

In a nutshell, the basic steps are:

* Preparing the device for development use (unlocking the bootloader).
* Finding appropriate the sources (mainly the kernel).
* Writing the expressions to build said sources.

== Kernel configuration

The `bin/` folder containing the following scripts is located at the root of the
mobile-nixos git repository and uses a `#!/usr/bin/env nix-shell` shebang in
order to run with their dependencies.

The kernel can be configured using the following command, where `$DEVICE` is
the device name.

```
 $ bin/menuconfig $DEVICE
```

When importing a configuration from another source, manually editing the kernel
configuration, or updating the kernel version, it is recommended to run the
kernel configuration normalization too.

```
 $ bin/kernel-normalize-config $DEVICE
```

Be mindful of your `$NIX_PATH` when running these tools. Ensure it points to
the Nixpkgs checkout you use to work on Mobile NixOS or else it may build the
toolchain fresh.
